# LightBnB Project

A simple multi-page Airbnb clone that uses a server-side Javascript to display the information from queries to web pages via SQL queries.

## Final Product

The registration page. The user can register an account so they can start creating short URLs. Login page is similar.

This is the URLs page. Here, once a user is logged in, they will be able to see the URLs they have stored. The stored URLs will also showcase what their short URL is. The user, if the URLs belong to them, can edit and delete the URLs.

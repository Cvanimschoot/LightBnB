# LightBnB Project

A simple multi-page Airbnb clone that uses a server-side Javascript to display the information from queries to web pages via SQL queries.

## Final Product

This is the landing page. Here you can see all property listings. Nav bar navigation is also at the top of the page with the ability to log in and out, as well as narrow the properties list based around search parameters.

This is the login page. Users can login to the webpage and create their own listings, as well as see their currently reservered listings.

The search page is used to be able to narrow the list of properties down based on criteria the user may want to look for.
